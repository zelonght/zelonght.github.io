	The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it "the Riddle House," even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there.  It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face.  Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.
	The Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was "creepy."  Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.  The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.  Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place:  Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.  
	The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.
	"Lying there with their eyes wide open!  Cold as ice!  Still in their dinner things!"
	The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement.  Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular.  Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.  All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.
	The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders.  They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just  been arrested.
	"Frank!" cried several people.  "Never!"
	Frank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener.  He lived alone in a run-down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.  Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.
	There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.
	"Always thought he was odd," she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.  "Unfriendly, like.  I'm sure if I've offered him a cuppa once, I've offered it a hundred times.  Never wanted to mix, he didn't."
	"Ah, now," said a woman at the bar, "he had a hard war, Frank.  He likes the quiet life.  That's no reason to --"
	"Who else had a key to the back door, then?" barked the cook.  "There's been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as I can remember!  Nobody forced the door last night!  No broken windows!  All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping..."
	The villagers exchanged dark looks.
	"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough," grunted a man at the bar.
	"War turned him funny, if you ask me," said the landlord.
	"Told you I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn't I, Dot?" said an excited woman in the corner.
	"Horrible temper," said Dot, nodding fervently.  "I remember, when he was a kid..."
	By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.
	But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.  Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.
	Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.
	The police had never read an odder report.  A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all.  In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead.  The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?
	As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.  The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while.  To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.
	"'S far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police say," said Dot in the Hanged Man.  "And if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it."
	But Frank did not leave.  He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed long.  Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.

	The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for "tax reasons," though nobody was very clear what these might be.  The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however.  Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.
	Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either.  Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House.  They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth.  Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare.  They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.  Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer.  So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.
	It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age.  He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee.  Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.  Frank knew at once what was going on.  The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.
	Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths.  He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door.  He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.  
	The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows.  Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.
	He let himself into the cavernous kitchen.  Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.  He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.
	On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were:  At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.  Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
	The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate.  This surprised him.  Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.
	"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry."
	"Later," said a second voice.  This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind.  Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up.  "Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail."
	Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.  There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor.  Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place.  He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.  Then he went out of sight again.
	"Where is Nagini?" said the cold voice.
	"I -- I don't know, My Lord," said the first voice nervously.  "She set out to explore the house, I think..."
	"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail," said the second voice.  "I will need feeding in the night.  The journey has tired me greatly."
	Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard.  There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.
	"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?"
	"A week," said the cold voice.  "Perhapse longer.  The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet.  It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over."
	Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it.  Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word "Quidditch," which was not a word at all.
	"The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?" said Wormtail.  (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)  "Forgive me, but -- I do not understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over?"
	"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double-checking identities.  They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything.  So we wait."
	Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear.  He had distinctly heard the words "Ministry of Magic," "wizards," and "Muggles."  Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code:  spies and criminals.  Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.
	"Your Lordship is still determined, then?"  Wormtail said quietly.
	"Certainly I am determined, Wormtail."  There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.
	A slight pause followed -- and the Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.
	"It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord."
	Another pause, more protracted, and then --
	"Without Harry Potter?" breathed the second voice softly.  "I see..."
	"My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!"  said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily.  "The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all!  It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard -- any wizard -- the thing could be done so much more quickly!  If you allowed me to leave you for a short while -- you know that I can disguise myself most effectively -- I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person --"
	"I could use another wizard," said the cold voice softly, "that is true..."
	"My Lord, it makes sense," said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now.  "Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected --"
	"And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute?  I wonder...perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail?  Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?"
	"My Lord!  I -- I have no wish to leave you, none at all --"
	"Do not lie to me!"  hissed the second voice.  "I can always tell, Wormtail!  You are regretting that you ever returned to me.  I revolt you.  I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me..."
	"No!  My devotion to Your Lordship --"
	"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice.  You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go.  How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours?  Who is to milk Nagini?"
	"But you seem so much stronger, My Lord --"
	"Liar," breathed the second voice.  "I am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care.  Silence!"
	Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once.  For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling.  The the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.
	"I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other.  I have waited thirteen years.  A few more months will make no difference.  As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective.  All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail -- courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldermort's wrath --"
	"My Lord, I must speak!"  said Wormtail, panic in his voice now.  "All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head -- My Lord, Bertha Jorkin's disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder --"
	"If?"  whispered the second voice.  "If?  If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died.  You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present condition...Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear.  I am not asking you to do it alone.  By that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us --"
	"I am a faithful servant,"  said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.
	"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement."
	"I found you," said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now.  "I was the one who found you.  I brought you Bertha Jorkins."
	"That is true," said the second man, sounding amused.  "A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail -- though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?"
	"I -- I thought she might be useful, My Lord --"
	"Liar," said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever.  "However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable.  Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail.  I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform..."
	"R-really, My Lord?  What -- ?"  Wormtail sounded terrified again.
	"Ah, Wormtail, you don't want me to spoil the surprise?  Your part will come at the very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins."
	"You...you..."  Wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry.  "You...are going...to kill me too?"
	"Wormtail, Wormtail," said the cold voice silkily, "why would I kill you?  I killed Bertha because I had to.  She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless.  In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays.  Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns..."
	Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.
	"We could have modified her memory?  But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her.  It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail."
	Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat.  The man with the cold voice had killed a woman.  He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement.  He was dangerous -- a madman.  And he was planning more murders -- this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was -- was in danger --
	Frank knew what he must do.  Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police.  He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village...but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.
	"One more murder...my faithful servant at Hogwarts...Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail.  It is decided.  There will be no more argument.  But quiet...I think I hear Nagini..."
	And the second man's voice changed.  He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.  Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.
	And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway.  He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.
	Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long.  Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer -- What was he to do?  The only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him --
	But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.
	There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling.  Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea...This man could talk to snakes.
	Frank didn't understand what was going on.  He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle.  The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move.  As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.
	"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail," it said.
	"In-indeed, My Lord?"  said Wormtail.
	"Indeed, yes," said the voice, "According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say."
	Frank didn't have a chance to hide himself.  There were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open.
	A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.
	"Invite him inside, Wormtail.  Where are your manners?"
	The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn't see the speaker.  the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.
	Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room.  Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold.
	The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls.  Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn't even see the back of his head.
	"You heard everything, Muggle?"  said the cold voice.
	"What's that you're calling me?"  said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.
	"I am calling you a Muggle," said the voice coolly.  "It means that you are not a wizard."
	"I don't know what you mean by wizard," said Frank, his voice growing steadier.  "All I know is I've heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have.  You've done murder and you're planning more!  And I'll tell youthis too," he added, on a sudden inspiration, "my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come back --"
	"You have no wife," said te cold voice, very quietly.  "Nobody knows you are here.  You told nobody that you were coming.  Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows...he always knows..."
	"Is that right?"  said Frank roughly.  "Lord, is it?  Well, I don't think much of your manners, My Lord.  Turn 'round and face me like a man, why don't you?"
	"But I am not a man, Muggle," said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames.  "I am much, much more than a man.  However...why not?  I will face you...Wormtail, come turn my chair around."
	The servant gave a whimper.
	"You heard me, Wormtail."
	Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair.  The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.
	And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it.  His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter.  He opened his mouth and let out a scream.  He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand.  There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled.  He was dead before he hit the floor.
	Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.

	Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard 

as though he had been running.  He had awoken 

from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his 

face.  The old scar on his forehead, which was 

shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath 

his fingers as though someone had just pressed a 

white-hot wire to his skin.
	He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the 

other hand reaching out in the darkness for his 

glasses, which were on the bedside table.  He put 

them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, 

lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering 

through the curtains from the street lamp outside 

the window.
	Harry ran his fingers over the scar again.  

It was still painful.  He turned on the lamp beside 

him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, 

opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on 

the inside of the door.  A skinny boy of fourteen 

looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled 

under his untidy black hair.  He examined the 

lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely.  It 

looked normal, but it was still stinging.
	harry tried to recall what he had been 

dreaming about before he had awoken.  It had 

seemed so real...There had been two people he 

knew and one he didn't ...He concentrated hard, 

frowning, trying to remember...
	The dim picture of a darkened room came 

to him...There had been a snake on a hearth rug...a 

small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a 

cold, high voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort.  

Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down 

into his stomach at the very thought...
	He closed his eyes tightly and tried to 

remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it 

was impossible...All Harry knew was that at the 

moment when Voldemort's chair had swung around, 

and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had 

felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken him...or 

had that been the pain in his scar?
	And who had the old man been?  For 

there had definitely been an old man; Harry had 

watched him fall to the ground.  It was all becoming 

confused.  Harry put his face into his hands, 

blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the 

picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying 

to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were 

now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to 

them...Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking 

about someone they had killed, though Harry could 

not remember the name...and they had been 

plotting to kill someone else...him!
	Harry took his face out of his hands, 

opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as 

though expecting to see something unusual there.  

As it happened, there was an extraordinary number 

of unusual things in this room.  A large wooden 

trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a 

cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted 

spellbooks.  Rolls of parchment littered that part of 

his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty 

cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually 

perched.  On the floor beside his bed a book lay 

open; Harry had been reading it before he fell 

asleep last night.  The pictures in this book were all 

moving.  Men in bright orange robes were zooming 

in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red 

ball to one another.
	Harry walked over to the book, picked it 

up, and watched on of the wizards score a 

spectacular goal by putting the ball through a 

fifty-foot-high hoop.  Then he snapped the book 

shut.  Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion, the best 

sport in the world -- couldn't distract him at the 

moment.  He placed Flying with the Cannons on his 

bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew 

back the curtains to survey the street below.
	Privet Drive looked exactly as a 

respectable suburban street would be expected to 

look inthe early hours of Saturday morning.  All the 

curtains were closed.  As far as Harry could see 

through the darkness, there wasn't a living creature 

in sight, not even a cat.
	And yet...and yet...Harry went restlessly 

back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger 

over his scar again.  It wasn't the pain that bothered 

him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury.  He 

had lost all the bones from his right arm once and 

had them painfully regrown in a night.  The same 

arm had been pierced by a venemous foot-long fang 

not long afterward.  Only last year Harry had fallen 

fifty feet from an airborn broomstick.  He was used 

to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were 

unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of 

Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for 

attracting a lot of trouble.
	No, the thing that was bothering Harry 

was the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been 

because Voldemort had been close by...But 

Voldemort couldn't be here, now...The idea of 

Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, 

impossible...
	Harry listened closely to the silence 

around him.  Was he half expecting to hear the 

creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak?  And then he 

jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give 

a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.
	Harry shook himself mentally; he was 

being stupid.  There was no one in the house with 

him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and 

Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their 

dreams untroubled and painless.
	Asleep was the way Harry liked the 

Dursleys best; it wasn't as though they were ever 

any help to him awake.  Uncle Vernon, Aunt 

Petunia, and Dudley were Harry's only living 

relatives.  They were Muggles who hated and 

despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry 

was about as welcome in their house as dry rot.  

They had explained away Harry's long absences at 

Hogwarts over the last three years by telling 

everyone that he went to St. Brutus's Secure Center 

for Incurably Criminal Boys.  They knew perfectly 

well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn't 

allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they 

were still apt to blame him for anything that went 

wrong about the house.  Harry had never been able 

to confide in them or tell them anything about his 

life in the wizarding world.  The very idea of going 

to them when they awoke, and telling them about 

his scar hurting him, and about his worries about 

Voldemort, was laughable.
	And yet it was because of Voldemort that 

Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first 

place.  If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would 

not have had the lightning scar on his forehead.  If it 

hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would still have 

had parents...
	Harry had been a year old the night that 

Voldemort -- the most powerful Dark wizard for a 

century, a wizard who had been gaining power 

steadily for eleven years -- arrived at his house and 

killed his father and mother.  Voldemort had then 

turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the 

curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches 

and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and, 

incredibly, it had not worked.  Instead of killing the 

small boy, the curse had rebounded upon 

Voldemort.  Harry had survived with nothing but a 

lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and 

Voldemort had been reduced to something barely 

alive.  His powers gone, his life almost 

extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in 

which the secret community of witches and wizards 

had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort's 

followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had 

become famous.
	It had been enough of a shock for Harry to 

discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a 

wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find 

out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world 

knew his name.  Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to 

find that heads turned and whispers followed him 

wherever he went.  But he was used to it now:  At 

the end of this summer, he would be starting his 

fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already 

counting the days until he would be back at the 

castle again.
	But there was still a fortnight to go before 

he went back to school.  He looked hopelessly 

around his room again, and his eye paused on the 

birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at 

the end of July.  What would they say if Harry wrote 

to them and told them about his scar hurting?
	At once, Hermione Granger's voice 

seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.
	"Your scar hurt?  Harry, that's really 

serious.... Write to Professor Dumbledore! And I'll 

go and check Common Magical Ailments and 

Afflictions.... Maybe there's something in there 

about curse scars. . . ."
	Yes, that would be Hermione's advice:  

Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in 

the meantime, consult a book.  Harry stared out of 

the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted 

very much whether a book could help him now.  As 

far as he knew, he was the only living person to 

have survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was 

highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his 

symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and 

Afflictions.  As for informing the headmaster, Harry 

had no idea where Dumbledore went during the 

summer holidays.  He amused himself for a moment, 

picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, 

full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched 

out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion 

onto his long crooked nose.  Wherever Dumbledore 

was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be 

able to find him; Harry's owl had never yet failed to 

deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.  

But what would he write?
	Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to 

bother you, but my scar hurt this morning.  Yours 

sincerely, Harry Potter.
	Even inside his head the words sounded 

stupid.
	And so he tried to imagine his other best 

friend, Ron Weasley's, reaction, and in a moment, 

Ron's red hair and long-nosed, freckled face 

seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused 

expression.
	"Your scar hurt? But ... but 

You-Know-Who can't be near you now, can he? I 

mean ... you'd know, wouldn't you? He'd be trying to 

do you in again, wouldn't be? I dunno, Harry, maybe 

curse scars always twinge a bit... I'll ask Dad. . . ."
	Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard 

who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts 

Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn't have 

any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as 

far as Harry knew.  In any case, Harry didn't like the 

idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, 

Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments' 

pain.  Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than 

Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron's sixteen- 

year-old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing 

his nerve.  The Weasleys were Harry's favorite 

family in the world; he was hoping that they might 

invite him to stay any time now (Ron had 

mentioned something about the Quidditch World 

Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit 

punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.
	Harry kneaded his forehead with his 

knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost 

shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like - 

someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose 

advice he could ask without feeling stupid, 

someone who cared about him, who had had 

experience with Dark Magic....
	And then the solution came to him. It was 

so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn't believe 

it had taken so long - Sirius.
	Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried 

across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled 

a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his 

eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then 

paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, 

still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of 

Sirius straight away.  But then, perhaps it wasn't so 

surprising - after all, he had only found out that 

Sirius was his godfather two months ago.
	There was a simple reason for Sirius's 

complete absence from Harry's life until then - 

Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard 

jail guarded by creatures called dementors, 

sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to 

search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped.  

Yet Sirius had been innocent - the murders for 

which he had been convicted had been committed 

by Wormtail, Voldemort's supporter, whom nearly 

everybody now believed dead.  Harry, Ron, and 

Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had 

come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous 

year, though only Professor Dumbledore had 

believed their story.
	For one glorious hour, Harry had believed 

that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because 

Sirius had offered him a home once his name had 

been cleared.  But the chance had been snatched 

away from him - Wormtail had escaped before they 

could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius 

had had to flee for his life.  Harry had helped him 

escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, 

and since then, Sirius had been on the run.  The 

home Harry might have had if Wormtail had not 

escaped had been haunting him all summer.  It had 

been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing 

that he had so nearly escaped them forever.
	Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some 

help to Harry, even if he couldn't be with him.  It 

was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school 

things in his bedroom with him.  The Dursleys had 

never allowed this before; their general wish of 

keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled 

with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock 

his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs 

every summer prior to this.  But their attitude had 

changed since they had found out that Harry had a 

dangerous murderer for a godfather - for Harry had 

conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was 

innocent.
	Harry had received two letters from Sirius 

since he had been back at Privet Drive.  Both had 

been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with 

wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical 

birds.  Hedwig had not approved of these flashy 

intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow 

them to drink from her water tray before flying off 

again.  Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; 

they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, 

and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius 

never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he 

was enjoying himself.  Somehow, Harry found it 

hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in 

bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had 

gone South.  Sirius's letters, which were now hidden 

beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under 

Harry's bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them 

he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry 

needed to.  Well, he needed to right now, all right...
	Harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as 

the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly 

crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, 

when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when 

sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle 

Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his 

desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread 

his finished letter.

Dear Sirius,
	Thanks for your last letter. That bird was 

enormous; it could hardly get through my window. 

Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet 

isn't going too well. My aunt found him smuggling 

doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him 

they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps 

doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his 

PlayStation out of the window. That's a sort of 

computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid 

really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part 

Three to take his mind off things.
	I'm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are 

terrified you might turn up and turn them all into 

bats if I ask you to.
	A weird thing happened this morning, 

though. My scar hurt again. Last time that happened 

it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I 

don't reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can 

he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt 

years afterward?
	I'll send this with Hedwig when she gets 

back; she's off hunting at the moment. Say hello to 

Buckbeak for me. Harry

Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right.  There was 

no point putting in the dream; he didn't want it to 

look as though he was too worried.  He folded up 

the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready 

for when Hedwig returned.  Then he got to his feet, 

stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. 

Without glancing at his reflection he started to get 

dressed before going down to breakfast.
