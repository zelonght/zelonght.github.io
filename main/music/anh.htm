There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up 
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child 
Such a dream, oh oh oh 
(rpt 1) 

I just wanna be here beside you 
And stay until the break of dawn 

You're looking for somewhere to belong 
You're standing all alone 
For someone to guide you on your way 
Now and forever 
(rpt 1) 

I just wanna be anybody 

We're living in different ways 
It's a beautiful life 
I'm gonna take you to a place 
I've never been before oh yeah

With you tonight

Baby won't you tell me why there is sadness in your eyes 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
Love is one big illusion I should try to forget 
But there is something left in my head 

You're the one who set it up 
Now you're the one to make it stop 
I'm the one who's feeling lost right now 
Now you want me to forget every little thing you said 
But there is something left in my head 

I won't forget the way you're kissing 
The feelings so strong were lasting for so long 
But I'm not the man your heart is missing 
That's why you go away I know 

You were never satisfied no matter how I tried 
Now you wanna say goodbye to me 
Love is one big illusion I should try to forget 
But there is something left in my head 

I won't forget the way you're kissing 
The feelings so strong were lasting for so long 
But I'm not the man your heart is missing 
That's why you go away I know 

Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere 
Don't know which way to go 
There ain't so much to say now between us 
There ain't so much for you 
There ain't so much for me anymore 

I won't forget the way you're kissing 
The feelings so strong were lasting for so long 
But I'm not the man your heart is missing 
That's why you go away I know!!!

She leeds a lonely life - she leeds a lonely life 

When she woke up late in the morning light 
and the day has just begun 
she opened her eyes and thought 
o' what a morning 
it's not a day for work 
it's a day for catching tan 
just laying on the beach and having fun 
she's going to get you 

all that she wants is another baby 
she's gone tomorrow boy 
all that she wants is another baby 
all that she wants is another baby 
she's gone tomorrow boy 
all that she wants is another baby 

all that she wants - all that she wants 

so if you are in sight and the day is right 
she's the hunter you're the fox 
the gentle voice that talks to you 
won't talk forever 
it's a night for passion 
but the morning means goodbye 
beware of that is flashing on her eyes 
she's going to get you 

all that she wants ...
